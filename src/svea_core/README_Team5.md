# Team 5 Implementation 

## **Important to read if code review for Team 5 is to be done!** 

The implementation done by Team 5 can mostly be found under the `svea_starter/src/svea_core` directory. At that location one will also find the particular `svea_starter/src/svea_core/README.md` for the Team 5 implementation. Any specifics regarding the implementation can hopefully be found there.

# Quick Guide To Start the Simulation
Run one of two options in a terminal: 

    > roslaunch svea_core t5_q1.launch 
    
to start the simulation outside the Q1 lecture hall or 

    > roslaunch svea_core t5_floor2.launch

to run the simulation on floor 2. For specific 

# To run the code on the real car
 there are two separate launch files called: `t5_svea.launch`, and `t5_svea_q1_.launch`. Setup you hardware as instructed in the `svea_starter/README.md` and respective tutorials and run one of these launch files instead.

# Quick Note
 **The reason to why the README is placed in `svea_starter/src/svea_code` is because the entire implementation written by Team 5 is contained in that directory**
